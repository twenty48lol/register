### NS records
When applying for NS records, please consider if you *actually* need them. Please provide a detailed reason (with evidence) of why you require NS records.

9 times out of 10, you do not actually need NS records, and merely want them. We already support a wide range of records, so it is extremely unlikely you will actually require them.

***Pull requests adding NS records without valid reasoning will be closed.***

**Instant Denials**:
- I don't want to create a pull request everytime I want to update my DNS records.
  - Over 3,000 people have to, you can too.
- I want to use Cloudflare's proxy for DDoS protection.
   - Simply add `"proxied": true` to your file, to enable Cloudflare's Enterprise-level DDoS protection for your subdomain.
   - Note: We *may* allow certain users to register NS records if it would expose their home IP.

For any questions regarding NS records, feel free to email support@is-a.dev.
